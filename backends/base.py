class BackendInterface(object):
    """
    This abstract class provides the main functions that need to be implemented for a backend:

    * exists()
    * load()
    * save()
    * delete()
    * lock()

    Each of these member functions must be specialised by child backend objects. For example, if
    considering a file-system backend, the `exists` function could test the whether a file
    exists. Backends are primarily designed to provide guarantees of the serialised data types.
    
    The lock function is not abstract and it creates a lockfile object. The scope of the lock is
    best managed with a with statement. For example, a file called `test.lock` will be created
    upon `__enter__` and this will be unlinked when `__exit__` is called. If the file `test.lock`
    already exists, a `mldb.locker.FileLockExistsException` will be raised.

    interface = BackendInterface(name='test')
